# This config is for SONOFF SNZB-02 devices, connected via zigbee bridge
# and zigbee2mqtt. The devices where renamed to SONOFF-SNZB-02-X, where
# -X is a consecutive number.
mqtt:
  # Required: The MQTT broker to connect to
  broker: broker.example.com
  # Optinal: Port of the MQTT broker
  # port: 1883
  # Optional: Username and Password for authenticating with the MQTT Server
  #user: <username>
  #password: <password>
  # Optional: Used to specify ClientID. The default is <hostname>-<pid>
  # client_id: somedevice
  # The Topic path to subscribe to. Be aware that you have to specify the
  # wildcard.
  topic_paths:
    - zigbee2mqtt/#
  # Optional: Regular expression to extract the device ID from the topic
  # path. The default regular expression, assumes that the last "element"
  # of the topic_path is the device id. The regular expression must contain
  # a named capture group with the name deviceid. For example the
  # expression for tasamota based sensors is "tele/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*".
  # The default is:
  # device_id_regex: "(.*/)?(?P<deviceid>.*)"
  device_id_regex: "zigbee2mqtt/(?P<deviceid>.*)"
  # Optional: Expect a single metric to be published as the value on an
  # mqtt topic. This regex is used to extract the metric name from the
  # topic. Must contain a named group for `metricname`.
  metric_per_topic_regex: ".*/(?P<metricname>.*)-[0-9]"
  # The MQTT QoS level
  qos: 0
influxdb:
  # machine on which influxdb runs on port 8086:
  server: influxdb.example.com
  # Database or bucket or however it will be called in InfluxDB v3...
  database: zigbee
  # Optional for InfluxDB v1.x, required for InfluxDB v2.x.
  organization: my-org
  # If a token is required, you can specify it here (but be careful that you
  # don't commit it a public git repo or something similar! Or you can use
  # an environment variable 'INFLUXDB_TOKEN'
  # For InfluxDB v1 this is 'username:password', for InfluxDB v2 the token
  # token: <token>
